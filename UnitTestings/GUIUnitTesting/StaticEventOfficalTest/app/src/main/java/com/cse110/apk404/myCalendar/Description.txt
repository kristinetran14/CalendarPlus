StaticEvent Object fields:
private String Id; //Id is in the format of DateKey + Name + startTime such as 18022016CSE1102359
private String dateKey; //dateKey is the date of the event in the format of 12 Feb 2016
private String name;  //name of the event
private Calendar startTime; //startTime as a Calendar object
private Calendar endTime; //endTime as a Calendar object
private boolean isStatic; //if the event is static
private boolean isPeriodic; //if the event is periodic
private boolean isFinished; //if the event is finished
private String location = ""; //location of event
private String description = ""; //description of event

Calendar Object fields:
private int YEAR; //for example 2016
private int MONTH; //1 to 12
private int DAY; // 1 to 31
private int HOUR_OF_DAY; //0 to 23
private int MINUTE; //0 to 59
private int DAY_OF_WEEK; //1 to 7
private String monthString; //Jan Feb ...

StaticEventList:
private ArrayList<StaticEvent> list; //list of all static events
private ArrayList<StaticEvent> events; //list to store all events in one given day

Main Function, called EventListHandler:
to create static event, use
public boolean createStaticEvent(String name, String location, Calendar startTime, Calendar endTime,
			boolean isStatic, boolean isPeriodic, boolean isFinished, String description) throws CalendarError
returns a boolean depending on success or not, this will automatically generate a DateKey which is the way to get all the events
in a single day. DateKey is in the format of 12 Feb 2016.

To delete all events call 
public void clear()

To remove an event by its Id, call
public boolean removeEventById(String Id) throws CalendarError
this is return true/false depending on whether the event has been removed

To get all the events in one single day for list view, call
public ArrayList<StaticEvent> getStaticEventsByKey(String key) throws CalendarError
This will return an ArrayList of static event objects


Work in Progress..... Dynamic events and sort algorithm, commented out for testing of static events
