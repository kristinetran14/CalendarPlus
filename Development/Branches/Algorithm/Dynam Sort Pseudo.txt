Dynamically allocate events using priority queue

1st priority queue: deadline time, event name, event estimated completion time, location
Get events and put them in a priority queue
comparator is the deadline of each event
queue will sort events from earliest deadline to latest deadline

compare estimated completion time and total free time: if not possible, print message saying time not enough


2nd priority queue: free time blocks (12p - 3p) (anything < 1h is not considered as free time)
comparator will be length of free time
this queue will split the time into smaller blocks

function compare: pop from top of priority queue(smallest time block from both)
compare two values and subtract the smaller value from the larger value, put the remainder of the larger value back into the priority queue that the larger value came from. Put the smaller value into a List.
